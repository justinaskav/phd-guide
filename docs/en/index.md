# Introduction

**Welcome to the Student Guide for PhD students 
at the Life Sciences Center of Vilnius University!** 

**The purpose** of this guide is:

- to describe the organisation and administration of
doctoral studies at the LSC
- to familiarise students with the components of the PhD
programme such as examinations, training, reports and dissertation preparation, including
the accompanying processes and formalities (requests, forms, etc.). 

This guide is not an
official document and is not intended to be treated as such. However, its sections have been
prepared in accordance with the official regulations describing various aspects of doctoral
study at LSC and VU. The texts here were also reviewed by the administration of the LSC Doctoral
School. We have written this guide with the aim of providing our PhD students with a
reliable source of information that addresses the most common questions in a convenient
format.

As LSC takes the leadership to internationalise the life sciences community in Lithuania, we
see the importance of having a student guide that is understandable to every doctoral
student in our center. 

Please note, however, that some of the official documents and legislations that regulate our studies
and are referred to in the text are in Lithuanian. We have tried to translate the most
important parts of these regulations, and most importantly, we ought to explicitly describe the
procedures that are adapted at our center.

We fully understand that there are and will be some questions that go beyond the scope of
this guide, or that the guide itself requires further explanation. 

In these cases: 

- please do not hesitate to contact the relevant student representative and / or the Doctoral School
administration;
- inform us about any issues you encounter while using this guide, so that we can improve it in the future.

Finally, we hope that this Student Guide will be maintained and updated by prospective
student representatives and the administration according to the evolving regulations and
procedures for doctoral study within LSC and VU. Importantly, any doctoral student is
entitled to suggest changes and additions to this living document so that it can better fulfil its
function.

Sincerely,

The Authors
