# Exams and Courses

All doctoral students must study at least three doctoral subjects and earn a certain number
of credits according to their study plan during their four years of study.

For students enrolled in 2017-2019. 33 ECTS credits must be accumulated during the
doctoral studies. 30 credits must be earned from the doctoral study subjects listed in the VU
doctoral programmes and the remaining 3 credits from transferable skills training (see
below).

For students enrolling in 2020 or later. 30 ECTS credits must be earned during the
doctoral studies. At least 25 credits must be earned from the subjects listed in the doctoral
programmes. It is recommended to collect up to five credits (! but not less than 3 credits)
from transferable skills training and the remaining credits must be collected by passing the
exams of the doctoral study subjects.

## Subjects and Exams

There are many subjects and exams that you can choose from since you are not limited to
the subjects enlisted in the PhD programme you are taking. For example, if you are a
biochemistry PhD student you can still choose to take a statistics exam from a medicine
programme. Subjects should provide knowledge to complete your PhD thesis. One subject is
usually worth 6 to 10 credits, the exact number of credits is stated in the description of the
exam programme. Most PhD students must pass 3 to 4 exams during the four years of their
studies to collect the required number of credits.

You must choose the subjects you will study during your doctoral studies at the very
beginning of the studies when you draw up your study plan. During planning, you must
choose an approximate date for the examination date (year and quarter of the year). 

If the expected date is missed, you must write a request to the Doctoral Committee requesting a
postponement of the date for the missed examination. It is also possible to change a subject
in your study plan if the Doctoral committee approves your request to update the plan (see
information above).

## Preparing for and taking exams

Read the subject description carefully before attempting to take the exam. Find out what
type of exam it is and what the consulting professor expects of you and how it might relate to
your doctoral topic. Sometimes you will have to attend lectures for a semester and then take
the exam. The exam may be written or in the form of an individual task, but most often
professors require a 45–60 minute presentation. 

In this case, it is recommended that you
think about the topics that would be useful for your research and discuss them with your
supervisor and the consulting professor of the subject. Start reading and preparing your
presentation as soon as possible. This is because there will always be work to do in the lab
and important things to do, but exams must be completed before the set deadlines.
We strongly recommend that you practise giving this presentation with your peers and
supervisors before the exam. Remember that this presentation is very important and very
long. So, practising delivering it and speaking out loud will help you a lot in the actual exam.
Expect questions - the examining panel will not miss an opportunity to test whether you
know the topic well. Most of the time the questions are directly related to the presentations,
but the professors may also ask general questions to test your knowledge in the exam area.

If you are thinking of taking an exam, follow this step-by-step guide:

1. Think of a topic for your presentation and contact the consulting professor to make
sure he or she agrees with the topic.
2. Contact the consulting professor again and discuss your progress. The consultant
may want to see your work before the exam or discuss the information you will be
presenting.
3. The consultant will also need to appoint two additional members of the exam panel.
4. Please ensure that the consulting professor of the subject has informed the Doctoral
School administrator Kristina Slavuckytė (e-mail kristina.slavuckyte@gmc.vu.lt )
about the exam and has provided with the following information for the preparation
the order:
 a. Date and time of the exam;
 b. Subject;
 c. Title of your talk (if the exam is a presentation);
 d. Members of the examination jury;
 e. Type of exam: either virtual or live.
5. If this is the first exam you are taking and you started your PhD before 2022,
print the [protocol for the exams](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/doktoranturos-mokykla/doktoranturos-studijos#dokumentu-pavyzdzai) 
(your evaluation will be filled in paper form):
6. This will be the only document proving that you have passed the exams and received
the credits. The judges will sign this paper after each exam and give you a grade.
Protect this paper at all costs. We recommend that you make a copy after each exam
and keep it in a safe place.
7. Take the exam.
8. After the presentation the examination jury will decide on the grade. After the meeting
they will sign your exam protocol and write the grade.
9. Congratulations on passing your exam. Make a copy of exams protocol and keep it
safe until the next exam.
10. After all planned exams are finished scan this protocol with all collected signatures
and send it to the administrator Kristina Slavuckytė, just to keep a backup. The
original has to be summitted to the Office of doctoral and postdoctoral studies of VU.

!!! note "For PhD students who started their studies after 2022"

    Your evaluation will be filled into Avilys by administrator Kristina Slavuckytė. Please, make sure to remind that to consulting professor.
