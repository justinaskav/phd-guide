# Plan of Doctoral Studies

Within two months of starting the doctoral programme, the doctoral student, with the support
of the supervisor, draws up a work plan for the doctoral studies, the scientific research and
the preparation of the doctoral thesis, which:

- lists the courses to be taken and the examination dates;
- describes the research programme and the stages of its implementation, the preparation of the dissertation;
- lists the expected publications and planned mobility activities such as internships and conferences.

[More information on organisation of doctoral studies / work plan](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/doctoral-school/phd-studies#organization-of-doctoral-studies)

Individual doctoral study plans are approved and amended at a meeting of the relevant
Doctoral Committee within the same two-month period. The plan forms can be found here:

- [Plan form (English)](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/doctoral-school/phd-studies#document-forms)
- [Plan form (Lithuanian)](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/doktoranturos-mokykla/doktoranturos-studijos#dokumentu-pavyzdzai)

## Exams

The scope of doctoral studies comprises at least 30 credits. A doctoral student studies at
least 3 courses related to a doctoral project, which must be listed in the plan, and at least
3 ECTS credits must be earned for participation in general (transferable) competency
development activities. 

One may select courses from a list offered to students in all science
fields at VU but may need to demonstrate the need for a course from another field when the
plan of study is evaluated by the Committee. In addition, there are minor variations and
restrictions for students in [various doctoral programmes in LSC](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/doctoral-school/phd-studies#description-of-study-course-units). It is strongly
recommended that doctoral students schedule their examinations with quarterly accuracy
within the first two years of their doctoral programme.

!!! warning "For students enrolled in the **Biochemistry** programme"

    If a student does not have a BSc or MSc in Biochemistry, the “Functional Biochemistry” or “Structural Biochemistry” exam must be included in the study plan.

It is recommended to allocate up to 3 to 5 credits (out of a total of 30 credits) for the
development of general competences through participation in special courses for doctoral
students at VU, international summer/winter schools and workshops, and participation in
conferences or internships. 

These credits could also be awarded for supervising Bachelor's
or Master's students or for teaching. General skills training must be listed in the study plan
without specifying the activities. To have general skills credits approved by the Doctoral
Committee, you must submit an application and table of activities to the Committee, or they
will not be granted.

The request and table of activities can be found [here](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/doctoral-school/phd-studies#document-forms).

More information on the activities and the expected number of credits for the development of
general competences can be found [here](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/doctoral-school/phd-studies#general-competence-skills-development).

!!! warning "Decision on the number of credits"

    The final decision on the approval of these activities and the number of credits awarded is made by the **respective Doctoral Committee**.

It is recommended to submit these documents together with the annual progress report.
Please send all completed documents to the doctoral studies administrator Kristina
Slavuckytė.

## Plan of scientific research and preparation of doctoral thesis

It is recommended to think about all the stages of a doctoral research project thoroughly and
to list them in chronological order so that the plan could really serve as a guide during the
studies. **The research programme** should be drawn up according to the form with the
allocated time periods for each part of the doctoral research project. 

The programme shall
consist of the following parts: 

1. study of research literature; 
2. formation of methodology;
3. theoretical and empirical studies;
4. analysis of collected data; 
5. preparation of the dissertation. 

All work listed in the plan must be completed by the end of the study period at
the latest. The scope of dissemination of the research results should correspond to that
required for the defence of the dissertation. The progress of the doctoral student’s research
activities will be assessed during the annual review.

Please note that writing a dissertation is embedded in the plan (students usually plan it for
the last year of study). Therefore, you must submit a draft of your dissertation to the doctoral
Committee prior to the final annual review ([see more](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/doctoral-school/phd-studies#progress-report)).

## Planned mobility activities

Doctoral students are required to present their results at international events such as
conferences and symposia (both live and online). Each student must present their work in at
least two events, regardless of the type of presentation (oral or poster presentation). It is not
necessary to indicate the exact event and date in the plan if these are not yet known (for
example, the indication “Presentation of results at an international conference” is sufficient).

Any scheduled internships also should be listed in the plan.

## Planned publications

Doctoral students must publish their results in at least two papers in research journals with
an assigned citation index in the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science (CA WoS) database in
order to be admitted to the dissertation defence. Therefore, it is necessary to list the
publications in the doctoral study plan. If the title and/or journal of the future publication is not
known (which is often the case), such an entry will work: “Publication on (dissertation topic)
in a scientific journal (CA WoS Impact Factor > x)”. Please remember that the doctoral
candidate must be the first author of one of the two publications to acquire the right to
defend the dissertation.

## Approval of study plan by the Doctoral Committee

Within the first two months of doctoral studies, the Doctoral School administration organises
meetings of the respective Doctoral committees to approve the study plans. The original
study plan, signed by the doctoral candidate and his/her supervisor, must be submitted to
the Doctoral School at least three working days before the Doctoral Committee meeting.
Together with the work plan, all doctoral students must also submit the consent of
supervisors and consultants, if any. If a supervisor/consultant does not work for VU, they
must also submit a list of their publications.

If the respective Doctoral committee so foresees, meetings are organised with the doctoral
candidate at which the doctoral candidate presents his/her prepared study plan to the
Committee and has 10 minutes for a presentation in which these aspects are explained:

- Preliminary dissertation title and supervisor’s name
- Academic background of the student
- Plan of the doctoral studies (exams)
- Outline of the planned research

However, the Doctoral Committee may decide to approve the study plan electronically. The
Committee evaluates each plan and approves it or suggests corrections.

!!! warning "For students enrolled in Biochemistry, Biology, Biophysics, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, and Zoology programmes"

    When presenting the plan, the Committee will also ask for the source of funding for the research.

## Changes and updates to study plan

The doctoral study plan may be changed, and examination dates may be postponed for
acceptable reasons (such as illness, internships or other). Any changes to the plan must be
approved by the respective Doctoral Committee. To do so, a doctoral student must complete
a request form, obtain the supervisor’s permission to change the plan of study, and submit
the signed request to the Doctoral School administrator. 
The form could be found [here](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/doctoral-school/phd-studies#document-forms).

In order to change the subjects in the work plan, the doctoral student [must submit a request for a change of subject](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/doctoral-school/phd-studies#document-forms) 
to the committee, stating the reasons, and the study
plan after the changes. Changes to the study plan may only be approved on the condition
that the minimum number of credits required by the VU regulations is accumulated.

If necessary, a consultant may be assigned to the doctoral student at any stage of the
studies. To do so, a request must be submitted to the Doctoral Committee, together with the
consent of the desired consultant and a list of his/her publications. Any active researcher
may be appointed as a doctoral consultant.
