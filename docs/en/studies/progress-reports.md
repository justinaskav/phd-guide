# Progress Reports

Progress reports are prepared at the end of each year and should be submitted to the
Administrator of Doctoral Studies Kristina Slavuckytė by 15 September, no matter when your
PhD started. The aim is to monitor how well doctoral students are sticking to the plan of their
doctoral studies. It is also important for the committee to know how successful the doctoral
student is in carrying out their research and to note their progress of the doctoral student and
observe any difficulties or problems.

It is important to note that doctoral students are required to submit progress reports for their
doctoral studies before the start of the next academic year (for example, by 1 October) in
accordance with the study plan. In the doctoral students' study plan, the fourth (final) year of
the doctoral studies or part of it is set aside for the preparation of a doctoral thesis. Doctoral
students must therefore submit a draft of the dissertation as a proof of compliance with the
study plan. The template and guidelines for writing a dissertation can be found here:

The reports signed by the doctoral candidate and his/her supervisor are submitted to the
Doctoral school. Please be sure to send them by e-mail (kristina.slavuckyte@gmc.vu.lt) by
the 15th of September. The presentation of the reports takes place after the end of the
current academic year (usually in October, except for doctoral candidates funded by the
Lithuanian Research Council), the exact date and time will be announced by the
administrator of the Doctoral School. The doctoral candidate must present the report to the
Committee in the presence of the supervisor. If the supervisor is unable to attend such a
meeting, he/she must provide the Committee with written feedback on the doctoral student’s
work during the reporting period.

During the presentation of the reports, the doctoral students show what they have achieved
in the past year. These are the most important things that should be mentioned when
preparing the presentation:

- present the main work that has been done
- indicate all exams planned and passed
- indicate whether you have attended conferences, summer schools
- the participation in general skills development activities
- provide a complete a list of publications (if any).
