# Doctoral Studies at Life Sciences Center

The aim of doctoral studies is to train scientists who are able to conduct
independent scientific research and experimental development and solve scientific
problems.

## Doctoral Committees and Programmes

The doctoral studies in a certain scientific field are formed by the doctoral committee - a
group of high-ranking scientists - and the implementation of the studies and research is
supervised by it. It`s main tasks are:

- to ensure a high scientific standard of the defended dissertations;
- to propose and approve amendments to the doctoral study programmes;
- to propose dissertation topics to the Rector of Vilnius University;
- to submit to the Rector for approval the composition of the commission for the entrance examination to the doctoral studies;
- submit the academic supervisors of the doctoral students (PhD) to the Rector for approval;
- to approve the plan (and subsequent amendments) for the doctoral studies and research of doctoral students;
- to carry out the annual evaluation of the doctoral students' reports (attestation);
- to examine the submitted dissertation and decide whether the doctoral candidate can defend his/her dissertation;
- to form a committee for the defence of a doctoral thesis.

You can find the list of doctoral committees at the [Contacts](../contacts.md#phd-committees) page.

## Joint Doctoral Studies

To promote and expand international exchange, joint doctoral studies can be carried out with
other universities. In this case, an agreement on joint doctoral studies is signed between
Vilnius University and a foreign university. If the joint doctoral studies are planned to be
carried out in the scientific field in which the University has a joint doctoral programme, the
joint doctoral agreement must be coordinated with both institutions. The agreement must
regulate the issues of joint doctoral studies, the defence of the dissertation and the financial
obligations of the University.
