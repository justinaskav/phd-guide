# Transferable Skills

Transferable skills are general skills acquired through additional formal training, teaching,
mentoring or other means. Excluded are any activities that have a financial reward.
The VU organises formal courses for PhD students on various topics and transferable skills.
You can find the available courses here:

In English: https://www.vu.lt/en/studies/doctoral-studies/trainings
In Lithuanian: https://www.vu.lt/studijos/doktoranturos-studijos/mokymai
Please note that registration is mandatory for these courses. The amount of ESTC credits
granted for these courses is given in the course description.

Other sources of transferable skills credits include the following:

- Courses in summer/winter schools and workshops.
- Teaching.
- Mentoring.
- Scientific events
- Organizing events.
- Internships, etc.

The expected number of credits for certain activities can preliminary be adjusted in advance
according to the guidelines (! Please note that the final decision on the approval of these
activities and the number of credits awarded is made by the respective Doctoral Committee):

- [In English](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/images/ECTS_credits_calculation.xlsx)
- [In Lithuanian](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/images/ECTS_kredit%C5%B3_skai%C4%8Diavimas.xlsx)

To obtain the credits, you must submit a request to the Doctoral Committee in which you
describe the activity:

- The activity (course, workshop, conference, etc.);
- The number of ETSC credits granted for that activity (if any);
- Or the number of hours dedicated for a particular activity (if no ECTS credits are awarded for the activity; the Committee will assess how many credits it is worth).

Proof of participation in an activity described (for example, a certificate if a course or
workshop was attended) must be attached to the request.

It is recommended that you submit a request to the Committee to estimate the number of
credits and/or approve credits for general skills development, along with reports after you
have accumulated a significant number of credits, or to find out how many credits will be
approved for those activities where the exact number of credits is not specified.
Please note that each student must keep a record of credits earned from transferable skills
training or other activities. Also, if you didnâ€™t get certificate after the course, please, contact
the course organisers. The Doctoral school does not have an accessibility to any of
certificates.
