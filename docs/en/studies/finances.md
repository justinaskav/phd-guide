## State funding of Doctoral studies

Approximately 11,837 € (in 2024) is allocated to each doctoral student annually by the
Lithuanian government excluding scholarships. 21 proc. of the total funds are used for the
general needs of the university and €35 for the Doctoral Assurance Fund. The actual
amounts may vary slightly from year to year, depending on the government budget in any
given year. The remaining funds (~6000-7000€) are managed by the departments in which
the studies are conducted and are intended for the direct (for example reagents, etc.) and
indirect (administration, electricity, supervisor salary, etc.) needs of doctoral studies.

## Scholarships

Scholarships: first year students receive 19 BSI (basic social benefit, equivalent to 55 € in
2024) /month and students of the following years receive 22 BSI/month.
Funds for the doctoral studies’ execution

From 2020, a part of these remaining funds reaching the LSC is allocated for direct research
purposes to be used by doctoral students, called funds for doctoral studies’ execution.
Each doctoral student pursuing full-time studies receive a certain amount of funds. The
Council of Life Sciences Center determines these funds during the annual LSC budget
approval in March/April. These funds are administered by the Doctoral School and can be
used by doctoral students with the approval of their supervisor. A part of the funds
(approximately 2000 €) allocated to 4th year PhD students is reserved to cover the
costs of their dissertation defence.


| Year | Funds for the doctoral studies’ execution |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| 2020 | 1527.33 €                                |
| 2021 | 2500 €                                   |
| 2022 | 3000 €                                   |
| 2023 | 3250 €                                   |
| 2024 | 3300 €                                   |
| 2025 | 3650 €                         |

The funds can be used for immediate needs, such as laboratory equipment, reagents, PC
equipment, printed materials, literature, academic trips, etc. Doctoral students must submit
invoices for goods and equipment purchased to the VU Life Sciences Center to the public
procurement specialist ~~Laimutė Čekutienė, office No 513, email laimute.cekutiene@cr.vu.lt~~
by 1 December of the calendar year. However, unused funds are not lost at the end of
the year and can still be used the following year.

Tangible assets (for example, computer equipment) with a price of 500 € and more
(including VAT) can be purchased for the current calendar year if the tangible assets to be
acquired were indicated in the Doctoral School's procurement plan. The doctoral candidate
and his/her supervisor must inform the head of the Graduate School by 1 November of the
current calendar year of the planned acquisition of tangible assets in the following year.
Together they must submit a justification for the necessity of the planned acquisition of
tangible assets.

### Doctoral studies funded by the Research Council of Lithuania

Doctoral students funded by the Research Council of Lithuania are eligible for the same
scholarships as any other doctoral student. However, their funds for carrying out doctoral
studies are managed differently. This type of doctorate is grant-based, and your supervisor
(who has applied for and received funding for the doctoral project) is responsible for
managing the funds. The Doctoral School is not responsible for this. Funding is received by
the institute to which you are affiliated. The amount provided is approximately 8000 € per
year for four years and can be used for the same expenses as regular doctoral funds and
mobility costs.

### How to use funds for doctoral studies’ execution

#### Buying

The most convenient way to use these funds is to purchase reagents under contracts
concluded by Vilnius University with suppliers. The most recent contracts and the procedure
for purchasing can be found in the table here.

A written order contract must be signed for the purchase of reagents from suppliers.
Currently, most order contracts are signed by LSC staff authorised by the Rector with an
electronic signature. Check who in your group/institute is authorised to do this.
The order contract must be completed for each order (there may be several invoices), but
the deadline for delivery of the goods: no later than 30 calendar days after the conclusion of
the order contract.

For the correct completion of the order contract, you may contact ~~Laimutė Čekutienė (laimute.cekutiene@cr.vu.lt, Office No C513)~~

If the products are not in any of the catalogues for which Vilnius University has a
contract, the purchase is possible only after filling in the application for public procurement.
Invoices received before the application is submitted will not be considered! To complete the
application, please contact Laimutė Čekutienė. It is necessary to provide Laimutė with
detailed information about the product (its technical specification) to be purchased, its price
and its supplier.

Taking care of the purchase documents. Once the purchase has been made and you
have received the products and the invoice, the invoice must be signed by you and your
supervisor, and by the person materially responsible person in your laboratory. Then deliver
the invoice to the public procurement specialist Laimutė Čekutienė (office No C513).
It is advisable to spend the money as soon as possible, as invoices will not be accepted for
payment after 1 December, but as mentioned above, the remaining funds will still be
available next year.

### Funding for the academic trips

The funds allocated each year for each doctoral student can also be used to cover mobility
activities, including travel, luggage, accommodation, insurance, fuel, visa costs and event
registration fees. The daily allowance can also be covered from this funding source. Other
funds such as project funds or scholarships can also cover academic travel. Regardless of
the source of funding, doctoral students must apply for academic trip by completing a
request form.

- Mobility request form (English)
- Mobility request form (Lithuanian)

To fill the form correctly and guarantee that your expenses will be covered please follow the
steps below.

0. Do not spend any money on the trip before you have received the rector’s
order for the trip!
1. Complete the request form for the Rector by indicating the city and country of the
destination and the purpose of the trip. Indicate the dates of departure and return
(not the days of the event).
2. Check the relevant costs to be covered and indicate the type(s) of funds used. If
mobility funds are to be used, indicate the assigned funding type number:
111017173. If you are willing to cover expenses from other sources, indicate them
and provide the funding type number and the expenses/amounts covered by each
source.
3. (optional) You can ask the Doctoral School or the accountant Ilma Jonaitytė (email:
ilma.jonaityte@cr.vu.lt , phone 2687008) for advice after the Rectorate decision has
been issued (step 5). The Doctoral School or the accountant will provide you with all
the necessary information.
4. Have the request signed by you and your supervisor and submit it to the Doctoral
School administration. Along with the request, you must submit the information
confirming an event you plan to attend (e.g., e-mail confirming acceptance of your
abstract, conference programme, etc.)
5. Wait for the Doctoral School administrator to notify you of the approval of your
request and the issuance of a Rectorate decision for travel.
6. Collect receipts for registration payments, flight tickets (including boarding passes),
luggage fees, local transportation tickets, rental receipts, invoices, etc. Print out bank
statements for payments made by card.
7. Submit the tickets, receipts, invoices and bank statements to the accountant Ilma
Jonaitytė within three working days of your return so that your expenses can be
covered.

### Christmas’ Scholarships or Students’ encouragement for academic achievements

At the end of each year, the Department of Doctoral and Postdoctoral Studies finalises the
use of doctoral funds throughout Vilnius University. Sometimes these funds are not fully
utilised during the year because students go on academic leave or for other reasons. In such
a case, the PhD department may decide to distribute the remaining funds to all PhD students
at the university. There are several options for the distribution: an equal distribution to all
PhD students, a different distribution to first year and second to fourth year students, and an
individual distribution according to the scientific productivity of each student during the past
year. In the latter case, students would receive an additional scholarship calculated
according to the points they have received for scientific publications in the Web of Science
journals Q1 and Q2 or for international patents. The formulas for points calculation are
described by the regulations of the Lithuanian Ministry of Education, Science and Sport and
Vilnius University as well as in the regulations of individual LSC institutes (BMI, BTI and
BChI).

Thus, every December you can hope for extra funds for your Christmas presents, especially
if you have had a productive year publishing articles! However, you shouldn’t get your hopes
up too high, as these distributions don’t normally take place every year.
