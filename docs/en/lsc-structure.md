# Administration and Structure of Life Sciences Center

## Institutes of Life Sciences Center

[Life Sciences Center (LSC)](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/about/structure) is an amalgamation of three research institutes[^embl]:

- the [Institute of Biotechnology](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/ibt),
- the [Institute of Biochemistry](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/ibch), 
- the [Institute of Biosciences](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/ibs)[^ibs]

[^embl]: Since September 2020, a *sui generis*
[Department EMBL Partnership Institute](https://www.gmc.vu.lt/en/lsc-embl) has also been operating in LSC. 
[^ibs]: Institute of Biosciences is the former **Faculty of Natural Sciences**. 

The institutes are subject to their own statutes and regulations but are an integral part of the LSC.

The institutes have their own **departments (laboratories)** that have their own *de facto* leader.
These department heads answer to the **director of the Institute**. The director is appointed for
five years and is the chief academic and administrative officer. 

### Insitute Advisory Boards

The institutes also have an **advisory board** that discusses and gives
proposals on scientific, academic, financial and
other matters and assists the director in coordinating the activities of the laboratories.
Depending on the institute, the institute advisory board may consist of the director, the
director‘s secretary, the administrator, the department heads, the representative of the
doctoral students and three independently elected scientists of the institute.

The advisory board holds meetings more or less frequently, depending on the institute. In
theory, they should take place at least once every two months, but in practice they are held
quite irregularly. 

Frequency of advisory board meetings with the current Directors: 

- The Institute of Biotechnology holds weekly meetings;
- The Institute of Biochemistry organise meetings when the Director (or 1/3 of the Board) requests it;
- The Institute of Biosciences does not have an advisory board. Instead, the institute holds
    general meetings where all employees are invited to discuss the institute's activities and
    future plans. These meetings are usually held quarterly.

## LSC Doctoral (Graduate) School

The LSC Doctoral School is the department of the Doctoral institution that organises doctoral
activities at the LSC. 

The strategic objective of the Doctoral School is to be an organisational
model for the academic and administrative doctoral programmes that guarantees the quality
of academic work and the efficiency of administration. 
Its objectives are the planning, development and monitoring of doctoral programmes and
other training activities in the field of research.

**<u>Prof. Dr. Daiva Baltriukienė</u> is the current Head of the LSC Graduate School.**

The Doctoral School can answer all your questions about your doctoral studies: funding
(including Vidutė Bobinienė, the financier), mobility programmes, forms, examinations, credit
scores, interdisciplinary courses, learning opportunities. *But first don't forget to check the guide for answers*. 

There can be, of course, other challenges?

- Do you have problems with your
supervisor? Come for a talk, and we will try to find a solution.
- Do you have a suggestion for a
doctoral programme? Let us hear it! Did you like some interdisciplinary courses? Write your
experiences to the administrator then the Doctoral School knows which electives to promote.

The administrative part of the Doctoral School includes all the paperwork concerning your
doctoral studies:

- The Study Plan
- Organisation of the exams
- Mobility paperwork
- Finances
- Requests for exam changes and postponements
- And others

Finally, all the paperwork for your doctorate must be filed in the office of the administrator
Kristina Slavuckytė. She is the holder of the Holy Grail aka. Your PhD files. And better
electronically than paper. If you have any questions, please e-mail her. She always
answers!

The Doctoral School organises events in collaboration with other doctoral representatives.
Please check your student mail and Microsoft Teams for notifications.

To summarise: 

- the LSC Doctoral School is our inside help. They know how the institutes
regulate their doctoral students and the doctoral committees, as well as they have a
comprehensive knowledge of OUR Life Sciences issues, which is beneficial for our future as
scientists.
- on the other hand, the **[Department of Doctoral and Postdoctoral Studies at Vilnius University](/en/contacts/#vu-doctoral-and-postdoctoral-studies-department)** is the outside help center. 
General questions about your doctoral studies will be answered there. 
They will answer most of the general questions you have or direct you to another source of information. 
The ability to use multiple sources of information is always a good strategy.

## Director, Council and Directorate

So, we talked about the Institutes, The Graduate School, and how everyone reports to them.
But to whom the directors report? The *Boss of it all* — the **LSC director, dr. Arvydas Lubys**, elected in 2024. The director is elected for a five-year cadence as the
head of the Life Sciences Center. 

The director is appointed by the **LSC Council**, which
comprises of fifteen members: 

- three LSC professors and / or senior scientists;
- three associate professors and / or senior researchers;
- three members of the academic and / or
non-academic community, 
- three student representatives, 
- two representatives of the Center's social partners 
- the director.

The LSC council discusses the most decisive topics of the LSC: the strategy of the LSC. How will the LSC
innovate? What is the demand? How will we promote interdisciplinarity? How will we attract
foreign students? How to cultivate our strengths and abolish our weaknesses? And will the
LSC budget allow us to implement such ideas? Yes, the budget. The most important and
interesting meeting of the LSC Council is the budget overview and discussion. 

LSC Council meetings are completely open to everyone[^closed-council], so definitely listen in when it happens.

[^closed-council]: In very rare occassions, meetings of the LSC Council can be closed to the public.
