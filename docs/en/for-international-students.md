Students from third countries that do not belong to the European Union must take care of
their own health insurance. It may be possible for the costs of health insurance to be
covered from your doctoral funds. For this option, you should contact the administrator for
doctoral studies. It is possible to do this after you have received the TRP.

## Social Insurance Services (SODRA)

From accessing the various types of social insurance benefits available to residents,
to managing pensions, Sodra is the agency serving individuals who contribute to
Lithuania’s social insurance fund.

Students who are not employed and are receiving only a university student stipend
do not need to contribute to SODRA.

Only students when they are employed or post-doctoral researchers need to pay
taxes to SODRA. However, employees with legal contracts do not need to worry
about paying their own taxes – employers pay them on behalf of employees. As
such, contracted employees only need to declare their income for the previous
calendar year if they want to receive tax refunds or verify the taxes they have paid.
If you are a student and do not work, you do not need to register at STI or provide
any other information.
