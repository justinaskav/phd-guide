# Frequently Asked Questions

??? question "What if I have problems with my supervisor?"

    Start by trying to resolve the issue directly with your supervisor. If that doesn't work, contact your institute's doctoral committee chairperson or the Doctoral School administration for assistance. Student representatives and other PhD students can also provide support, advice and share their experiences.
