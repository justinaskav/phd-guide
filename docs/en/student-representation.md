# Doctoral student representation

Regular discussion is the key to improvement. So, it is not wrong to say that the frequency of
meetings is directly proportional to how loud the doctoral student representative's voice is.
Of course, the doctoral student representative can request a meeting with the director of the
institute individually or enquire if a meeting with the whole board can be organised if there is
a need.

**Representatives are elected for a one-year period**. We will enforce this provision so that
other doctoral students could experience what it is like to be on a 'governing body' of their
institute. Because regardless of how the system works now, the fact that the representatives
meet with each other and always maintain open communication is a step in the right
direction.

## Current representatives

Currently, the representatives are as follows:

### At the Institute level


| Institute | Representative (PhD course) - Year | Email | Office |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Institute of Biotechnology | **Lukas Krasauskas** (Biochemistry PhD) - 2<sup>nd</sup> Year | lukas.krasauskas@gmc.vu.lt | C449 |
| Institute of Biochemistry | **Greta Mačiuitytė** (Biochemistry PhD) - 2<sup>nd</sup> Year | greta.maciuityte@bchi.stud.vu.lt | C411 |
| Institute of Biosciences | **Bernadeta Kaminskaitė** (Biology PhD) - 1<sup>st</sup> Year | bernadeta.kaminskaite@gmc.stud.vu.lt | V429 |


These people are the ones you should know in your institute. They will help you in any way
they can. You can always come to them if you have a problem or if you want the other
doctoral students to know something. They will be your voice.

### At the LSC Doctoral School level 


| Office number | PhD course, Year | Contacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C504 | Biology PhD - 4<sup>th</sup> year | vejune.pukenyte@gmc.vu.lt |


The representative is the Doctoral School's direct point of contact for doctoral student
opinions. At their meetings with the Doctoral School administration, the examination
programmes, changes to the regulations, new ideas for improving the doctoral programmes
and other aspects concerning the doctoral students are discussed.

### At the LSC Council level and Directorate


| Representative (PhD course) - Year | Email | Office |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Justinas Kavoliūnas (Biology PhD - 2<sup>nd</sup> Year) | justinas.kavoliunas@gmc.stud.vu.lt | C337 |


The doctoral student representative on the LSC Council should already be familiar with how
the system works, so the representative is elected in a slightly different way to the others.
Only doctoral students who have served as doctoral student representatives either in
institutes or in the Graduate School can nominate themselves for this position.

The doctoral student representative on the LSC Council may be also a part of the
**Directorate**, which advises the LSC Director on organisational matters. The Directorate
includes the three directors of the Institutes, the head of the Doctoral School and the
aforementioned representative of the doctoral students. This is the golden ground for
innovative ideas to improve the improvement of doctoral studies. If you succeed in
convincing the directors, you can incorporate your ideas into the life of the LSC.

Do you have crazy ideas that you want to bring to life, which would improve the life of
doctoral students in the LSC? This is the representative you should
contact or who you want to become.

## How can I become a representative? 

Well, that’s quite simple. Nominate yourself.

In April, the Vilnius University Student Representation (VU SR) conference cycle begins,
during which representatives are elected. In these conference cycles, the new student
representatives are elected to the governing bodies of the core academic departments of VU
and VU SR. This conference is where YOUR nomination might be considered. In April, each
doctoral student will receive a letter with instructions on what steps they need to take to
nominate themselves. So, don’t be afraid and get involved!

Not only can you be nominated to represent the doctoral students in your
department/institute, but you can go one step further and get involved in shaping doctoral
studies as a doctoral student representative in the LSC Doctoral School changing
regulations… In order to control the flow of information and stabilise the chaotic life of
doctoral students, the Doctoral School was created.
